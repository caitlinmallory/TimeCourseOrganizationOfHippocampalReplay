data_interp = compute_dataInterpolation_fast(data,times);

% data should be a matrix where the first column is sample times
% times is the a vector containing the times you are interested in
% (i.e., spike times).
% this will simply pull out the nearest point in data and return the
% row of data at that point.

for i = 1:length(times)

    data_interp(i) = data(nearest_ind,:);
